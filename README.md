## Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Laptop data is from kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, converted to appropriate data types, and transformed into a suitable format for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is performed to understand data distribution, correlations between features, and identify interesting patterns.
4. **Modeling:** Several regression algorithms are used to build models, including Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using metrics Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.
6. **Deployment:** The best performing model is selected and deployed for use in an application or API.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for data exploration and model development.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning.
* **XGBoost:** For boosting algorithms.
* **Streamlit:** For creating simple web applications for model deployment.

## Results
* **Best Model:** Based on evaluation, the RMSE model performed best with an RMSE of 162
